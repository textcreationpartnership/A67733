1. Words of Command, and other Rules and Orders to be obſerved by all the Captaines of Horſe-Troops, and their Officers, within the Army, in the Exerciſing and Government of their ſeverall Troops.
FOr the Horſe, the Captain is to teach his Troop, (by his Trumpetter) theſe ſixe ſeverall ſounds,1 T
    _ The words of Command to be uſed in exerciſing them, are as follow:

    _ Orders to be obſerved in Marching of a Troop of Horſe.

    _ The Captain of Foot is to teach his Souldiers theſe ſixe once a day, till they are perfect in knowing them.

    _ Theſe 3 Figures or Formes following, are to practiſe the Foot Company before the words of Command be taught.

    _ When you will Exerciſe a Company Single, you Double your Ranks, before you Wheel, in regard the Body is ſmall. But in Diviſion, or a Greater Body, you Cloſe firſt, both your Files, and your Ranks, to your Order of Three foot, and omit the Doubling, and ſo Wheel. When you will Wheel to the Right hand, double your Ranks to the Left hand, and when you will Wheel to the Left hand, Double your Ranks to the Right. For ſo the Right and Left hand Leaders will keep their places on that Corner, towards which they Wheel.Before you Wheel:—

    _ This maner of opening, is uſed only in a Single Company; for in Greater Bodies, where the Doubling is omitted, you open firſt your Ranks, and then your Files, to your Open Order of Six foot, to bring them back again as they were.By double Diſtance is meant 12 foot, for ſo the Ranks which did before Double, falling out again into their firſt places, come juſt to the Diſtance of their open Order of 6. foot in which they were before they Doubled.After you have wheeled:

    _ For the Pike.

    _ For the particular uſe of the Muſquet.

    _ In Exerciſing, uſe theſe three Terms of Direction.

    _ In Advancing towards an Enemie, when they do not skirmiſh Looſe and Disbanded, they muſtThe Right and Left Wing in all occaſions of Giving Fire by Ranks, are to have a principall Reſpect to the Pikes, to make their Front equall with them, and to take their diſtances from them accordingly as when they ſtood firſt in Battell; And this may be the more certainly done, if the Ranks of the Right Wing take their Diſtances from the Pikes, by obſerving the Left hand man, as the Ranks of the Left Wing do by obſerving the Right hand man.Give Fire by Ranks, after this manner following.

    _ A manner, there is, to Give Fire retiring from an Enemy, which is performed after this ſort.

    _ We Give Fire by Flanks thus:

    _ Orders to be obſerved in the Marching of one ſingle Company, or of many joyned together in one Body.
